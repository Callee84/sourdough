     <h1>How to make your own bread.</h1>
     
     <p>We will start with just these four ingredients. This recipe is for about 2500 gram of bread (which I make into 2 loaves of bread and about 16 buns).</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>Flour 1400 gram</li>
            <li>Water 1000 gram</li>
            <li>Salt 35 grams</li>
            <li>Sourdough 250-300 grams</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

     <div class="recipe">
        <ol>
            <li>1. <br>The first step is to freshen up you sourdough. You should only have about a tablespoon of sourdough in your jar. Then add 150 grams of water and 150 grams of flour and stir.</li>
            <br>
            <li>2. <br>When your sourdough is starting to come alive and bubbles then it's time to start the dough. First of you start with mixing 1400 grams of flour and 1000 grams of water in to a smooth dough. Then let it sit under a wet cloth for about an hour.</li>
            <br>
            <li>3. <br>When your sourdough bubbles and has double in size it time to mix it in with the rest of the dough. Remember to save some sourdough in the jar for your next bake.</li>
            <br>
            <li>4. <br>Let the dough sit under the cloth again for about 45 min and then add the salt.</li>
            <br>
            <li>5. <br>After the 45 min it's time to "flip the dough" for the first time. There is a lot of ways to do this but just streching it in bowl is what I do.</li>
            <br>
            <li>6. <br>You need to flip the dough 4-6 times with 40 min in between.</li>
            <br>
            <li>7. <br>After you've fliped the dough about 5 times it's time to split it up in to loaves of bread and/ or buns and put them in basket. How many is entierly up to you.</li>
            <br>
            <li>8. <br>Put the baskets in a bigger box that you kan seal and then let it sit out for about 40 min and then put in the fridge for at least 12 hours and up to 48 hours..</li>
            <br>
            <li>9. <br>When it's time to bake it of put your oven on 220 degrees celcius. Loves of bread goes in the oven for about 35- 40 min depending on size and, well the oven itself.
                Buns goes in for about 13-15 min. <br>(Adding some steam for the first couple of minutes is a good way to let them expand. About 15 min with loaves of bread and 5 min with the buns.)</li>
        </ol>
