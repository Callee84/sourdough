<h1>How to make your own bread.</h1>
     <br>

<h3>It's accually much easier to bake your own bread than you might think. You will come a long way with only the love of bread, and a little bit of sourdough.</h3>
     <br>
     <div class="mid-sec-ind">
     <h2>All You Need Is Love</h2>
     <p>Although love will get you far in your baking, you will also need a bit of time and a good sourdough.<br>
     So exept for the love and the sourdough, what else do you need to make your own lovely sourdough bread.
        <br>
     Not that much accually. There's only 4 ingredients to make sourdough bread. Water, flour, sourdough and salt.
     To get you on your way, 
        I've listed a recipe on this site aswell. <br>Click <a href="recipe.html">the recipe link here</a> or in the header to check it out.<br></p>
     </div> 
     <div class="center-img" alt="a lovely piece of sourdough bread"></div>
    
     <p>With only those 4 ingredients you can get this. Now, isn't that pretty cool?</p>
