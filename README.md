# Project 1 - Sourdough Bread - HTML & CSS Portfolio.

So for my first project I choosed to work with subject quite close to heart - bread or more exactly sourdough bread.
The site, in all its simplicity, is designed as a simple (maybe not bakingwise) "getting started"- site with sourdough beaking.

## The Site
[Sourdough bread](https://callee84.github.io/surdegen/index.html)

## Features and UX
I've choosen a website with simple features so the visitor easily can navigate throghtout the site. The purpose of the site is the content and therefore a pretty plain site.

Starting with the sticky navigation bar at the top that follows the visitor down through the page for quick and easy navigation through the website. 

On the contact site I've put in a contact form in case any visitor need some help. Just now the submit-button takes the visitor to the start page which is index.html. 

The footer contians links to varius social media.

## Site Structure
The site contains four pages - index (loadingpage), recipe, sourdough and contact.
Consistent though tha pages are the image in the header but with a different heading on all pages.
As I described at the start the website has a very clean structure. As this is mainly a recipe-site it should be av very easy navigated site. 

##### The landing page (index)
Is designed as a simple welcome-page. Containing a quick welcome-text and an inspirational bread-picture. This picture also changes to a more mobilefriendly pic when sized down. A link in the text to the reicpe aswell as the sticky navigation.

##### Recipe
The recipe side is a made up by a 9 step list that is numbered. Above that list is another unordered list containing the ingridients.

This side is also made up by a list in 3 steps and describes how to make a sourdough starter.

## Testing
I've conducted 4 tests of the site. Two of the with focus on performance in webbrowser. 
The Lighthouse test using Goole Dev Tools scores the site with top gades exept for the performance with is in the low 90:s. The performance scores is draged down because of the big header image.

However I've also tested the sites performance using GT-metrix and got the score of 94. I feel this is within the margin of error and keep the picture in this size.

I've also tested the site using the w3c html checker with no reported warnings.
