# Project 1 - Sourdough Bread - HTML & CSS Portfolio.

So for my first project I choosed to work with subject quite close to heart - bread or more exactly sourdough bread.
The site, in all its simplicity, is designed as a simple (maybe not bakingwise) "getting started"- site with sourdough baking.

## The Site

## Features and UX
I've choosen a website with simple features so the visitor easily can navigate throghtout the site. The purpose of the site is the content and therefore a pretty plain site.

Starting with the sticky navigation bar at the top that follows the visitor down through the page for quick and easy navigation through the website. The navigation bar also has a hover function which highlights the current position. This hover-funnction also appears on the contact form and in the footer on the social media links.

On the contact site I've put in a contact form in case any visitor need some help. Clicking the submit-button takes the visitor to a confirmationpage named "thanks.html".

The footer contians links to varius social media.

## Site Structure
The site contains of five pages - index (loadingpage), recipe, sourdough, contact and a form response page called thanks.
Consistent thoughout the pages are the image in the header but with a different on-image-text on all pages.
As I described at the start the website has a very clean structure. As this is mainly a recipe-site it should be av very easy navigated site. 

##### The landing page (index)
Is designed as a simple welcome-page. Containing a quick welcome-text and an inspirational bread-picture. This picture also changes to a more mobilefriendly pic when sized down. A link in the text to the reicpe aswell as the sticky navigation bar.

##### Recipe
The recipe side is a made up by a 9 step list that is numbered. Above that list is another unordered list containing the ingridients.

This side is also made up by a list in 3 steps and describes how to make a sourdough starter.

Contact side consists of a form divided in to three textfields. The email and the quesiton-input is required to fill in to be able hit the submit-button.

#### Thanks
When the submit button is trigged it sends the visitor to a confirmation page containing a simple message that the form has been sent and an answer is to be expected.

## Testing
I've conducted 4 tests of the site. Two of the with focus on performance. 
The Lighthouse test using Goole Dev Tools scores the site with top grades exept for the performance with is in the low 90:s. The performance scores is draged down because of the big header image.

However I've also tested the sites performance using GT-metrix and got the score of 100 and 94 for structure. I feel this is within the margin of error and keep the picture in this size.

I've also tested the site using the w3c html checker and jigsaw css tetser with no reported warnings.
